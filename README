Breakfast Politics for Kindle
-----------------------------

This is horribly hacky at the moment, sorry.

Run the default rake task to retrieve all articles from the breakfastpolitics.com url, readability-ize them and generate a kindle-formatted file. 

You'll need a copy of kindlegen (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621) at bin/kindlegen
You'll also need to install node.js, npm and do an npm install of coffee-script, htmlparser, jsdom, libxmljs, readability, soupselect & step (I think)
Run a bundle install to retrieve the deps.
The generated mobi file will be in target/

Good luck. 

TODO:
- fix broken links and images from inside article bodies
- clean up story html beyond what readability does (remove header weather forecast crap, "continue after ad" stuff)
- parameterize stuff (retrieve the "current" url, etc)
- package node dependencies (http://www.google.com.au/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=npm+package.json)
- better rakefile
- actually just rewrite it from scratch with some test coverage :D
